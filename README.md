# taxonomy
This repository contains facets of the noslegal taxonomy in Excel, JSON and CSV formats.
There are two Excel files: one with the Places facet of the taxonomy and its extension packages, the second with the other facets of the taxonomy.
The repository also contains release notes in Word and Markdown formats, and a Powerpoint file containing slides on implementation .<br><br>
The taxonomy is intended for categorising legal work and related things (e.g. documents and experience).<br><br>
Use cases include financial reporting, legal operations and knowledge management.<br><br>
We suggest you read the release notes first.<br><br>
Previous releases are also available in the [Taxonomy Version Archive](https://github.com/noslegal/taxonomy/tree/main/taxonomy%20version%20archive) folder.
