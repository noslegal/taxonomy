# taxonomy
This repository contains (1) the eight facets of the noslegal taxonomy (v 3.0 release / March 2025) in Excel (2) release notes (3) a guide to the taxonomy
There are three Excel files. One contains facets 1 - 6 (laws, work types, sectors, participants, connectors, information assets). The second contains facet 7 (places) and a third with facet 8 (work elements).
json and csv versions will be added soon.
The taxonomy is intended for classifying legal work and related things (e.g. documents and experience).<br><br>
It is intended for use by legal services providers, legal departments and legal technology companies.
Intended uses are in the areas of opportunities (e.g. sales, marketing, sourcing), delivery (e.g. process, pricing, spend), knowledge and people (e.g. experience and training).<br><br>
We suggest you read the guide and release notes first.<br><br>
Previous versions of the taxonomy are available in the [Taxonomy Version Archive](https://github.com/noslegal/taxonomy/tree/main/taxonomy%20version%20archive) folder.
