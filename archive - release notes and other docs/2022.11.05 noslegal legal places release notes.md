**Taxonomy release notes**

**Release 1.1.0** / 05 November 2022

This document provides release notes for an update to our Legal Places taxonomy facet. 

## About Legal Places

Please see our [31 March 2022 release notes](https://github.com/noslegal/taxonomy) for a summary of Legal Places.

## Summary of release
- This release is a minor one. It does not extend the scope of Legal Places but reflects various changes and corrections since March 2022.
- Highlights include:
    - Change of official English name of Turkey to Türkiye – though, as in various other cases, we have retained Turkey as an alternative name in the taxonomy (useful as e.g. a synonym for search).
    - Some region and code changes.
    - Some non-English name changes.
    - Miscellaneous adjustments to legal system types based on further research and checking.
    - Additional names for South African provinces.
    - Updates to reflect new members of various international conventions.

## Acknowledgements
This update was largely prepared by Marius Manole, with a review by Graeme Johnston. Special thanks to Ruth Ward for help with South African province names.
