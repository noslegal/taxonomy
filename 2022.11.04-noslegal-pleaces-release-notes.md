**Taxonomy release notes**

**Release 1.1.0** / 04 November 2022

This document outlines the release notes for our Places taxonomy.

## Summary of Legal Places

Legal Places is more detailed than the other facets, but only because we
have built it upon the invaluable public domain foundation made
available by the United Nations and the International Standards
Organisation in cooperation with various national standards
organisations.

Legal Places has five main data sheets, each with one or more supporting
sheets.

Each sheet is intended to be modular. You can use it individually (or
even just use parts of it). But the sheets are also designed to work
well together.

They are largely independent from our other taxonomy facets (Legal Work,
Subjects and Contexts) though sheet 4.0 (connecting factors) ties in
closely with Legal Work and Legal Subjects.
